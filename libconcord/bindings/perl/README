==== BASIC INSTALLATION ====

0. INSTALL REQUIRED SOFTWARE

Swig is required to generate the perl bindings

1. GENERATE THE BINDINGS

   $ swig -perl5 concord.i

2. BUILD THE BINDINGS

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make

3. INSTALL THE BINDINGS

   $ sudo make install


==== USAGE ====

Simply use the module with:

   use concord;

Then every call available in the C API is available to you. Various functions
are slightly modified to provide a more perlish feel. See
libconcord/bindings/perl/test.pl for an example.

NOTE: You do *NOT* need to call delete_key_names() in perl, and in fact, it's
not available.


==== DIRECT USAGE ====

You can use the bindings from a non-system directory by specifying a
library path in your perl:

   use lib '/path/to/perl/module';
   use concord;

Or you can set your PERL5LIB environment variable:

   PERL5LIB=/path/to/perl/module ./perl-script

Note that since this perl module has a compiled object associated with
it, if the .so file isn't installed in a system library directory, you will
need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or otherwise tell your
linker where to find it.
