Compilation
====================

The Python bindings do not require compilation.

Pre-Requisites
====================

The Python bindings make use of the ctypes library. ctypes is included as part
of Python 2.5. It is also available as an optional module for older versions
of Python. See the following URL for pointers:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctypes/

Installation
====================

The Python bindings make use of distutils for installation purposes. distutils
is a standard part of Python. Simply run the following command:

python setup.py install

You will probably need to run this command as root, since installation
requires writing files to system directories.

Direct Usage
====================

Since the Python bindings do not require compilation, they may be used
directly without installation. To do this, simply add the directory containing
the bindings to your PYTHONPATH. For example:

export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/libconcord/bindings/python

Debugging
====================

If you set the environment variable LIBCONCORD_PY_TRACE to string "1", then
libconcord.py will trace all function calls. This may prove helpful when
debugging client applications.

For example, in bash:

LIBCONCORD_PY_TRACE=1 ./congruity /path/to/Connectivity.EZHex
