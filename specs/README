This is our attempt to write specs down as we discover/understand them incase
Logitech never releases specs.

INTRO

There are two general underlying protocols used... one by the non-z-wave
remotes, and one by z-wave remotes.

In addition, one of two transports is used: HID or LAN.

Finally, all remotes use USB as their physical medium.

These are coupled into a few combinations:

  non-zwave -> HID               -> USB
  zwave PIC -> faux UDP-over-HID -> USB
  zwave ARM -> TCP               -> USB

For 880 and below (plus the Monster AV-100), they all use USB and the
non-z-wave protocol.

The 890, 890pro, 895, and Monster AVL-300 all use z-wave over HID.

The 1000, 1000i and later use z-wave over LAN.

The individual protocols are documented in the following files:

  protocol.txt - pre-z-wave remote (880 and earlier) documentation
  protocol_z.txt - z-wave remote documentation
